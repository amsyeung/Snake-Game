###### Snake-Game
######
###### This project is my first time to programming a game. It's written by Python script.
###### As I want to practice my Python's understanding, I made this traditional snake game.
###### This snake game utilizes a library called pygame which includes many powerful component/modules
###### to design a GUI interface. You will see many usage such as the show the display or draw sth 
###### in the main program.
###### If you want to learn Python like me, download this program and study it, and re-write it by yourself.
###### Add more features into it, for example, adding a online game record which may apply the knowledge about
###### the socket and database. You will discover more and more.
###### If you're not interested in programming for now, you still can download it and enjoy the game:)
